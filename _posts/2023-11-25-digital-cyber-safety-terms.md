### Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

In an APT attack, a threat actor uses the most sophisticated tactics and technologies to penetrate a high-profile network. APTs aim to stay ‘under the radar’ and explore the network while remaining undetected for weeks, months, and even years. APTs are most often used by nation-state threat actors wishing to cause severe disruption and damage to the economic and political stability of a country. They can be considered the cyber equivalent of espionage ‘sleeper cells’.

### Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) are security solutions that defend against sophisticated malware or hacking attacks targeting sensitive data. Advanced Threat Protection includes both software and managed security services.

### Adware

Adware bombards users with endless ads and pop-up windows and causes a nuisance to the user experience. Adware can also pose a real danger to devices and the unwanted ads can include malware or redirect user searches to malicious websites that collect personal data about users. Adware programs are often built into freeware or shareware programs, where the adware operator collects an indirect fee for using the program. Adware programs usually do not show themselves in the system in any way. Adware programs seldom include a de-installation procedure, and attempts to remove them manually may cause the original carrier program to malfunction.
